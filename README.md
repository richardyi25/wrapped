# Spotify Data Analysis

Read [the blog](https://mastblog.github.io/2023/12/28/spotify-data-analysis.html) for more details!

This is a not-yet portable project to conduct various data
analyses of my Spotify listening activity.

The tech "stack" is:
- Rust to handle file loading, JSON parsing, connecting
to the SQL database, and making HTTP requests to Spotify's API
- Local MySQL database
- SQL queries for basic data analysis and R/Python for statistical inference
